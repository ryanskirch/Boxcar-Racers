# Boxcar-Racers

Senior project- Individual Game
Pick a track to drive one of four boxcars.  The standard boxcar, stylish carbon-fiber, clunky metal, or sleek aluminum.  It's not as easy as you think.  Stay away from the walls, because they will eat you alive.  Future iterations will include multiplayer, rewards, upgrades, and weapons.
